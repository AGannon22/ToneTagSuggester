# /ToneTag Suggester Overview

/ToneTag Suggester is a work in progress project that is intented to be a Google Chrome Extension that will suggest tone indicators to attach to emails.

## The Goal
Tone tags are often used by neurodivergent people who struggle to understand tone in written communications in many online spaces. Unfortunately, many of those in
professional spaces don't understand how to utilize them when communicating with coworkers who may need them. /ToneTag Suggester is meant to help bridge the gap by 
making tone indicators much easier to understand and use. With /ToneTag Suggester, people can begin to learn how to use tone tags in their communications for better 
inclusivity in the workspace, schools, and more.

student leads and volunteers made it happen. It was my first hackathon and I am so grateful for that experience.
